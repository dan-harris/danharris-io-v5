Are you a fan of the **Default Dark+** theme in vscode? Wish it was just slightly darker? Well have I got news for you! I’ve released a (slightly) darker variant of the **Default Dark+** theme that includes a few visual tweaks to minimise the editor chrome, comments & better highlight typings .etc. I’ve unimaginatively called this new theme **dark+ REDUX: Even Darker**.

So what does it look like?

Check out some further demos on the [extension homepage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=danharris.dark-plus-redux-even-darker#overview). Any problems or suggestions, feel free to raise a ticket on the [github page](https://github.com/dan-harris/dark-plus-redux-even-darker-vscode-theme). While your at it, I’d highly recommend grabbing a ligature style font like the [beautiful Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) or if you’re not keen on buying a font, you can patch something like [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) to [include an italic cursive variant](https://medium.com/@zamamohammed/multiple-fonts-alternative-to-operator-mono-in-vscode-7745b52120a0).

Hope you enjoy the theme! If you want to heckle, hit me up on twitter [@danharris_io](https://twitter.com/danharris_io).
